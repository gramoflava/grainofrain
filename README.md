# Grain of Rain

A client-side weather data analysis tool for exploring historical and current weather patterns across multiple cities.

## Philosophy

**Grain of Rain** is built on three core principles:

### 1. Complete Client-Side Operation
- Zero server infrastructure — runs entirely in your browser
- Direct integration with open weather APIs (Open-Meteo)
- Your data stays on your device, complete privacy by design
- No accounts, no tracking, no data collection

### 2. Single-Screen Information Density
- All relevant data visible at once — no scrolling, no tabs, no hidden panels
- Compare up to 3 cities side-by-side in a single view
- Statistical summaries and visual charts coexist on one page
- Dense information presentation without clutter

### 3. Exploration and Analysis Focus
- Historical weather data analysis across custom date ranges
- Cross-city comparisons to identify patterns and anomalies
- Climate deviation tracking (actual vs. climate normals)
- Flexible date ranges from single days to full years

## Value Proposition

The tool serves users who need to:
- Analyze historical weather patterns for research or planning
- Compare climate conditions across different locations
- Study temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind data
- Export insights as images for reports or documentation

## Technical Approach

Built with vanilla JavaScript and minimal dependencies to ensure:
- Fast loading and instant responsiveness
- Long-term maintainability without framework lock-in
- Full transparency — inspect and understand every line
- Works offline once loaded (with cached data)

## Development Philosophy

This is a **pure vibe-coded app** — developed through intuitive iteration and direct user feedback rather than upfront specifications. Features emerge from actual needs, the interface evolves toward clarity, and technical decisions favor simplicity over abstraction.

**Grain of Rain** is weather analysis without the cruft — just you, the data, and open APIs.
